                        Stage 1: Requirements Specification
                        -------------------------------------
The program must satisfy the following requirements:
    ■ It must let the user enter the interest rate, the loan amount, and the number of years
    for which payments will be made.
    ■ It must compute and display the monthly payment and total payment amounts.


                            Stage 2: System Analysis
                            ------------------------
The output is the monthly payment and total payment, which can be obtained using the fol-
lowing formulas:
                      loanAmount * monthlyInterestRate
monthlyPayment=     ------------------------------------- 
                                    1
                  1 -  -----------------------------           
                      (1 + monthlyInterestRate) ^ numberOfYears * 12  <------ exponent

                    totalPayment= monthlyPayment * numberOfYears * 12

So, the input needed for the program is the monthly interest rate, the length of the loan in
years, and the loan amount.

                                Stage 3: System Design
                             ----------------------------   
During system design, you identify the steps in the program.
    Step 1. Prompt the user to enter the annual interest rate, the number of years, and the
    loan amount.

    (The interest rate is commonly expressed as a percentage of the principal for a period of
    one year. This is known as the annual interest rate.)

    Step 2. The input for the annual interest rate is a number in percent format, such as
    4.5%. The program needs to convert it into a decimal by dividing it by 100. To
    obtain the monthly interest rate from the annual interest rate, divide it by 12,
    since a year has 12 months. So, to obtain the monthly interest rate in decimal
    format, you need to divide the annual interest rate in percentage by 1200. For
    example, if the annual interest rate is 4.5%, then the monthly interest rate is
    4.5/1200= 0.00375.

    Step 3. Compute the monthly payment using the preceding formula.

    Step 4. Compute the total payment, which is the monthly payment multiplied by 12 and
            multiplied by the number of years.

    Step 5. Display the monthly payment and total payment.
