/* 
 * Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount 
 * of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is:
 * 
 *                                              Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
 * 
 * where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules.
