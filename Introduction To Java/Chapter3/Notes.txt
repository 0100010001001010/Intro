The program can decide which statements to execute based on a condition

 A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value: true or false.

 The boolean data type declares a variable with the value either true or false.

 An if statement is a construct that enables a program to specify alternative paths of execution.

 A flowchart is a diagram that describes an algorithm or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting these with arrows.

 An if-else statement decides the execution path based on whether the condition is true or false.

 An if statement can be inside another if statement to form a nested if statement.

Forgetting necessary braces, ending an if statement in the wrong place, mistaking == for =, and dangling else clauses are common errors in selection statements.
Duplicated statements in if-else statements and testing equality of double values are common pitfalls.

You can use Math.random() to obtain a random double value between 0.0 and 1.0, excluding 1.0.

You can use nested if state to write a program that interprets body mass index.

The logical operators !, &&, ||, and ^ can be used to create a compound Boolean expression.

Logical operators, also known as Boolean operators, operate on Boolean values to create a new Boolean value.

The and (&&) of two Boolean operands is true if and only if both operands are true.

The exclusive or (^) of two Boolean operands is true if and only if the two operands have different Boolean values.

(number % 2 == 0 && number % 3 == 0) (line 12) checks whether the number is divisible by both 2 and 3. (number % 2 == 0 || number % 3 == 0) (line 15) checks 
whether the number is divisible by 2 or by 3. (number % 2 == 0 ^ number % 3 == 0) (line 18) checks whether the number is divisible by 2 or 3, but not both.

A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or if it is divisible by 400.

You can use the following Boolean expressions to check whether a year is a leap year:
                // A leap year is divisible by 4
                boolean isLeapYear = (year % 4 == 0);
                // A leap year is divisible by 4 but not by 100
                isLeapYear = isLeapYear && (year % 100 != 0);
                // A leap year is divisible by 4 but not by 100 or divisible by 400
                isLeapYear = isLeapYear || (year % 400 == 0);
Or you can combine all these expressions into one like this:
    isLeapYear = (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0);

The lottery program involves generating random numbers, comparing digits, and using Boolean operators.
