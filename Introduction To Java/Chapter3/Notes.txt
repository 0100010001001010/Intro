The program can decide which statements to execute based on a condition

 A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value: true or false.

 The boolean data type declares a variable with the value either true or false.

 An if statement is a construct that enables a program to specify alternative paths of execution.

 A flowchart is a diagram that describes an algorithm or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting these with arrows.

 An if-else statement decides the execution path based on whether the condition is true or false.

 An if statement can be inside another if statement to form a nested if statement.

Forgetting necessary braces, ending an if statement in the wrong place, mistaking == for =, and dangling else clauses are common errors in selection statements.
Duplicated statements in if-else statements and testing equality of double values are common pitfalls.

You can use Math.random() to obtain a random double value between 0.0 and 1.0, excluding 1.0.
