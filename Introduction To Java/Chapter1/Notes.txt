Chapter 1
---------
Java syntax is defined in the Java language specification, and the Java library is
defined in the Java API. The JDK is the software for developing and running Java
programs. An IDE is an integrated development environment for rapidly developing
programs.

Java language specification is a technical definition of the Java programming
language’s syntax and semantics.

Java is a full-fledged and powerful language that can be used in many ways. It comes in
three editions:
        ■ Java Standard Edition (Java SE) to develop client-side applications. The applications can run standalone or as applets running from a Web browser.
        ■ Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) to develop server-side applications, such as Java servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and JavaServer Faces (JSF).
        ■ Java Micro Edition (Java ME) to develop applications for mobile devices, such as cell phones.


A pair of curly braces in a program forms a block that groups the program’s components.
In Java, each block begins with an opening brace ({) and ends with a closing brace (}). Every
class has a class block that groups the data and methods of the class. Similarly, every method
has a method block that groups the statements in the method. Blocks can be nested, meaning
that one block can be placed within another, as shown in the following code.

TABLE 1.2 Special Characters
---------------------------------------------------------------
Character         Name                          Description
---------------------------------------------------------------
{}                Opening and closing braces               Denote a block to enclose statements.
()                Opening and closing parentheses          Used with methods.
[]                Opening and closing brackets             Denote an array.
//                Double slashes                           Precede a comment line.
""                Opening and closing quotation marks      Enclose a string (i.e., sequence of characters).
;                 Semicolon                                Mark the end of a statement.

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("3.5 * 4 / 2 – 2.5 is ");        Answer: 3.5 * 4 / 2 – 2.5 is 
        System.out.println(3.5 * 4 / 2 – 2.5);                      4.5
        
}
}

The compiler generates a bytecode file with a .class extension. Thus, the preceding command generates a file named Welcome.class

The bytecode is similar to machine instructions but is architecture neutral and can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

Java bytecode can run on a variety of hardware platforms and operating systems

(a) Java source code is translated into bytecode. 
(b) Java bytecode can be executed on any computer with a Java Virtual Machine.

LISTING 1.4 ShowSyntaxErrors.java
1 public class ShowSyntaxErrors {
2    public static main(String[] args) {
3       System.out.println("Welcome to Java);
4    }
5 }
      Four errors are reported, but the program actually has two errors:
          ■ The keyword void is missing before main in line 2.
          ■ The string Welcome to Java should be closed with a closing quotation mark in line 3. Since a single error will often display many lines of compile errors, it is a good practice to fix errors from the top line and work downward.
